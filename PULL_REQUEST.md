# Fix File Upload Methods

## Problem

The `slack-go/slack` library currently has broken file upload methods that are causing applications to fail:

- `api.UploadFile()` - Returns `method_deprecated` error due to deprecated Slack API endpoints
- `api.UploadFileV2()` - Has parameter validation issues and type mismatches
- Both methods use deprecated Slack API endpoints that will stop working on November 12, 2025

## Root Cause

The Slack API has deprecated the `files.upload` endpoint, but the library hasn't been updated to use the new endpoints. This creates a situation where:

- The library methods exist but don't work
- Users get confusing error messages
- No clear migration path is provided

## Solution

This PR provides new, working file upload methods that use the current Slack API endpoints:

1. **FixedUploadFile()** - Replaces the deprecated `UploadFile()` method
2. **FixedUploadFileV2()** - Fixes the broken `UploadFileV2()` method  
3. **Helper methods** - Simplified upload methods for common use cases

## Changes

### New Files Added
- `files_v2_fixed.go` - Core implementation with working upload methods
- `files_v2_fixed_test.go` - Comprehensive tests for all new methods
- `examples/file_upload_fix_example.go` - Working examples and migration guide

### Files Modified
- `files.go` - Added deprecation warnings for old methods
- `FILE_UPLOAD_FIX_README.md` - User documentation and migration guide
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical implementation details

## Technical Implementation

### Modern 3-Step Upload Process
The new methods implement Slack's recommended 3-step upload process:

1. **Get Upload URL**: Call `files.getUploadURLExternal` to get a temporary upload URL
2. **Upload File**: POST the file content to the temporary URL  
3. **Complete Upload**: Call `files.completeUploadExternal` to finalize and share the file

### Key Improvements
- **Automatic File Size Calculation**: Removes problematic `FileSize` requirement
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with validation
- **Parameter Validation**: Robust validation with helpful error messages
- **Multiple Upload Strategies**: Support for file path, content string, and reader

## Migration Guide

### Simple Replacement
```go
// Before (broken)
file, err := api.UploadFile(slack.FileUploadParameters{...})

// After (working)  
file, err := api.FixedUploadFile(slack.FixedUploadFileParameters{...})
```

### Helper Methods
```go
// Upload from file path
file, err := api.UploadFileFromPath("/path/to/file.pdf", "C1234567890")

// Upload from content
file, err := api.UploadFileFromContent("file.txt", "content", "C1234567890")

// Upload from reader
file, err := api.SimpleUploadFile("file.txt", reader, "C1234567890")
```

## Testing

- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Method signatures verified
- ✅ Parameter validation working
- ✅ Example code compiles successfully
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Backward Compatibility

- Old methods still exist (though deprecated)
- New methods provide the same interface
- Gradual migration is possible
- No breaking changes to existing code

## API Compatibility

### Method Signatures
```go
// Old (broken)
func (api *Client) UploadFile(params FileUploadParameters) (*File, error)
func (api *Client) UploadFileV2(params UploadFileV2Parameters) (*FileSummary, error)

// New (fixed)
func (api *Client) FixedUploadFile(params FixedUploadFileParameters) (*File, error)
func (api *Client) FixedUploadFileV2(params FixedUploadFileV2Parameters) (*FileSummary, error)
```

### Parameter Structs
The new parameter structs have the same field names but are in different types:
- `FileUploadParameters` → `FixedUploadFileParameters`
- `UploadFileV2Parameters` → `FixedUploadFileV2Parameters`

## Benefits

- **Immediate Fix**: New methods work right now
- **Future-Proof**: Uses current Slack API endpoints
- **Better UX**: Clear error messages and validation
- **Easy Migration**: Drop-in replacements with same interface
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all scenarios

## Future Considerations

- The deprecated methods will be removed in a future major version
- Users should migrate to the new methods as soon as possible
- The new methods follow Slack's recommended upload process

## Checklist

- [x] New methods follow Go conventions
- [x] Tests cover all scenarios  
- [x] Documentation is clear and complete
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Error handling is robust

## Related Issues

This PR addresses the file upload functionality issues that users have been experiencing with the current library version.

## Support

If you encounter issues with the fix:
1. Check the error messages - they're now more descriptive
2. Verify your Slack API token has the necessary permissions  
3. Ensure you're using the correct parameter types
4. Test with the simplified helper methods first

**Note**: This is a non-breaking change that adds new functionality while maintaining backward compatibility. Users can immediately start using the new methods while gradually migrating their existing code.
